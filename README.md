  - Completed: Created a way to input how much time was spent on each activity whenever making a post, made it so that posts are sorted by the newest posts first by default, fixed minor errors.
  - Next: Create a circle or bar graph that is unique to each account, that will show how much time that you've spent doing various activities and will thus allow the user to track their fitness levels better.
